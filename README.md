## Introduction

This is the official **Fall of the Gods API**, containing endpoints to get data about **characters**, **items**, **worlds**, **places** and **stories** from the main universe and the videogame.
This API also serves as the achievement management system for every **GYCODING** user for the game Leaves & Shadows.

We provide a full **[API reference](https://fallofthegods-data-gycoding.koyeb.app/)**, containing all the available **endpoints**, **documentation** and a **changelog** with the new features or bugfixes from all the versions of this API.

## How it was made
  
![Spring](https://img.shields.io/badge/Spring-6DB33F?style=for-the-badge&logo=spring&logoColor=white)
![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-4EA94B?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white)
![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-2CA5E0?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white)

This API REST uses **Spring Web** for the whole API REST functionality and **Spring Data** to access to our **MongoDB** database. For the deployment, **Docker** is being used along with **Koyeb** for the hosting.

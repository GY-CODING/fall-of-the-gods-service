# Introduction

This is the official **Fall of the Gods API REST**, containing endpoints to get data about **characters**, **items**, **worlds**, **places** and **stories** from the main lore and the videogame.

We provide a full **[API reference](https://fallofthegods-data.onrender.com)**, containing all the available **endpoints**, **documentation** *(Javadoc)* and a **changelog** with the new features or bugfixes from all the versions of this API.

<br>

# How it was made?

This API REST uses **Spring Web** for the whole API REST functionality and **Spring Data** to access to our **MongoDB** database.

The reference static website was made using just **HTML**, **CSS** and some **JavaScript**, while the documentation was made automatically using **Maven Javadoc Plugin** and **Javadoc comments**.
